To create the ``Inferer`` object you have to provide:
* The model file path.
* The pipeline file path.
```python
inferer = Inferer("model_path", "pipeline_path")
```

The ``predict_probability`` method receives a dataframe and returns a predicted probability of default.

```python
pd = inferer.predict_probability(data)
```
